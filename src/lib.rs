/// Analyzes a raw shell command line and returns the [`Verdict`] the hook
/// adapter should act on.
///
/// # Error posture
///
/// This function returns [`Verdict`], not `Result<Verdict, _>`. Every
/// failure mode internal to the pipeline — a parse error, an unrecognised
/// construct, anything the parse/normalise/rules/gate stages (plan.md §1.1)
/// cannot resolve statically — folds into a fail-closed `Ask` verdict
/// *inside* `analyze`, carrying a human-readable [`verdict::Reason`], rather
/// than propagating outward as an `Err` the caller has to remember to
/// handle.
///
/// Why: the hook adapter (`src/bin/shguard.rs`) sits on Claude Code's
/// PreToolUse stdin→stdout contract (plan.md §0.2) and must satisfy two
/// constraints at once — never crash (a panic there fails *open*, since the
/// tool call proceeds unguarded when the hook produces no decision) and
/// never silently allow (mapping an unhandled `Err` to `Allow` anywhere in
/// the adapter would be the same failure in the opposite direction).
/// Returning `Verdict` unconditionally, with every internal failure folded
/// to `Ask` at this one point, means there is exactly one place that has to
/// get the fail-closed mapping right (plan.md §1.2's "single fold point"),
/// and the adapter's job becomes trivial and impossible to get wrong: call
/// `analyze`, always get a `Verdict`, always emit a `permissionDecision`.
///
/// The pipeline itself — parse (`src/parser.rs`) → normalise
/// (`src/normalize.rs`) → rules (`src/rules.rs`) → structural gate
/// (`src/gate.rs`) → worst-decision-wins fold — is composed in
/// [`gate::analyze`]; see that module's docs for the full Block/Ask/Allow
/// rule set.

/// composition root via [`config::Policy::load`]) supplies the rules and
/// allowlist instead of the embedded defaults alone. [`analyze`]'s own
/// behavior and signature are untouched — this is an additional entry
/// point, not a replacement.
